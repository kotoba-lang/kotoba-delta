  "kotoba-delta — datom-native operation log for agent edits
  (ADR-2607161325; the 'Datomic-for-code-edits' answer to DeltaDB).

  Design stance vs DeltaDB (researched 2026-07-16, ADR-2607160005 P4):
  - Writers are agents emitting DISCRETE ops (Edit/Write/Remove), not human
    keystrokes — so no character-level text CRDT. Ordering comes from the
    log (transactor-style total order); convergence is by construction.
  - Conflicts are EXPLICIT (an :edit whose :op/old no longer matches is a
    first-class conflict value), never silent CRDT convergence — semantic
    conflicts can't be merged away, so surfacing beats converging.
  - Every op is Ed25519-signed by a did:key actor and parent-covering
    (op chain = tamper-evident; replay of an old op is structurally
    impossible) — the authorization layer DeltaDB says nothing about.
  - Admission rejects secret material (the 'op logs archive API keys'
    liability raised against DeltaDB) BEFORE it enters the log.
  - Conversation linkage: :op/turn ties an op to the agent conversation
    turn that produced it — provenance from prompt to line.

  Pure cljc; crypto injected ({:sign-fn :verify-fn :hash-fn}) like fleet.pin."
